      <h2>Ring Size Guide</h2>
    </div>
    <p><b>Method 1:</b> Get a ring that already fits your finger and follow these steps:</p>
    <p>_Step 1: Use a ruler with millimeter divisions to measure the inside diameter of the ring</p>
    <p>_Step 2: Compare the measured number of mm with the diameter of the rings below.</p>
    <p>_Step 3: Your ring number is the number written on the circle.</p>

    </div>
    <p><b>Method 2</b></p>
    <p>_Step 1: Take scissors, cut a piece of paper 5mm wide (with the tip of chopsticks) and wrap it around your finger.</p>
    <p>_Step 2: Take a pen to mark the junction, use scissors to immediately cut the marked part.</p>
    <p>_Step 3: Use a ruler to measure the length of the paper sample (For example, measure 55 mm), compare that measurement with the table above.</p>

    </div>

    <p><b>Attention: </b></p>
    <p>_You should measure 2 to 3 times and slowly and carefully wrap the paper around your finger for accurate measurement results.</p>
    <p>_If the weather is cold, your fingers may be smaller than normal, when measuring you should add 1 mm to the circumference. When the weather is hot, it's the opposite, so subtract 1 mm. In case your finger joints are large, you should measure the circumference near the joint (not on the joint), so when wearing the ring it will be easy but not loose.</p>
    <p>_With the above simple ways, I hope you can find suitable versions of love rings.</p>

      <h2>Bracelet Size Guide</h2>
    </div>
    <p><b>Method 1: </b>How to measure bracelet length</p>
    <p>Step 1: Use a string (or tape measure/thread/small piece of paper) to wrap around the wrist wearing the bracelet, marking the junction.</p>
    <p>Step 2: Measure the length of the string between one junction.</p>
    <p>Step 3: Compare the diameter you just measured (in mm) with the ring size table below. Your ring size corresponds to the size number written on the left. </p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Method 2: </b>How to measure bracelet diameter</p>
    <p>_This method is in case you are already wearing a bracelet</p>
    <p>_Use a ruler to measure the inside diameter of the bracelet.</p>
    <p>_After you have the size, compare the mm number of the ruler with the diameter size of the ring size table as shown above.</p>
    <p>_Your bracelet size is the size number written in the left column of the table below. After choosing the ring size</p>
